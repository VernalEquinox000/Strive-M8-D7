/* Cats As A Service

Goal

Using a TDD approach, create a simple JWT authentication service that allows access to an endpoint returning a random cat image.

Let’s use Cats As A Service: https://cataas.com/cat?json=true

Walkthrough

Start from today’s project: fork the repo and create a develop branch
Create a Continuous Delivery pipeline on Heroku for this project
deploy the current master in production
create and deploy a staging app
set "Automatic deploys from master (when CI is finished correctly)"
promote it to production
Don’t forget to add all TEST, REVIEW, STAGING and PRODUCTION environment vars.
When the pipeline is correctly setup, start writing these tests and their implementation:
When providing the Login endpoint with incorrect credentials:
expect requests to be rejected with code 401
When providing the Login endpoint with correct credentials:
expect a valid JWT Access token back (use jwt.verify as always)
When calling a “/cats” endpoint with the previously generated token:
expect requests to be accepted with 200 code
Expect the response.body.url to be defined
Expect the typeof url in response.body to be “string”
When calling the Cats endpoint without a valid token
expect requests to be rejected with code 401
Notes

Remember to keep separate environments:

Review apps automatically deployed from pull requests.
Staging automatically deployed from master branch.
Production deployed only when promoted from staging.
Until the end, the production environment is expected to be responding with a fake "VALID_TOKEN" when trying to login with valid credentials - just like in the latest master of today’s morning.

We’ll promote your working staging app to production together during debrief.

Good luck! :D
